# CSC 241 GitHub Greeter
In this assignment, you will edit a Java class by adding two 
methods that return greeting Strings. This is intended to give 
you practice using GitHub and Git commands. Remember to make commits 
frequently as you make changes!

## Steps

1. [Clone](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) this GitHub Repository to your 
computer
2. Find and open the `GitHubGreeter.java` file in your favorite editor/IDE
3. Add a new method to the class called `welcome` that returns a `String` 
and accepts one `String` parameter. The returned value should look like 
this, `Welcome to GitHub, <name parameter>.` Remember 
to [`git commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)!
4. Add another method called `wishes` that takes no parameters and 
returns a `String` of the form, `I hope you enjoy your class!`
5. Run the `main` method in the `Main` class to test your program. Again, 
make sure to `git commit`!
6. When you are confident that it is working, 
[push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) your 
updates to your GitHub repository. GitHub will run a series 
of tests to confirm the correct operation of the methods. If any 
tests fail, make the necessary corrections, commit, then push again.
